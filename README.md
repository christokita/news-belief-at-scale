## Project abstract
Using computational simulations, this project combines social media data and experimental survey data to create an estimate for exposure to and belief in top-trending news articles on Twitter.

The abstract from our paper:
> While online misinformation has become a growing topic of scholarly and public inquiry in recent years, the science of studying its impact and evaluating potential remedies at the scale of the social media ecosystem is still developing. On the one hand, research on the diffusion of and exposure to misinformation utilizes large-scale observational data, but these data provide little insight into belief. On the other, measurement of belief in misinformation is largely derived from surveys, which cannot capture the networked dynamics of belief's spread. These two methods have yet to be unified, leaving us without an ecosystem-level estimate of levels of belief in misinformation and the efficacy of interventions aimed at mitigating belief at scale. Here, we pair experimental survey data with observational Twitter data to estimate both exposure to and belief in trending true and false news. Using this new method, we find that the patterns of exposure and belief differ between true and false news: while true news is seen and believed by an ideologically balanced segment of the user base, false news is seen by an ideologically diverse set of users yet believed by an ideologically-skewed segment of the user base. Thus, efforts to infer the impact of misinformation by measuring exposure alone may not accurately capture the true impact of misinformation on social media. We extend this new method and conduct data-driven simulation to evaluate different interventions social media platforms deploy to curtail misinformation. We find that most interventions have a minimal impact on the number of people who see and believe misinformation and, importantly, that the effectiveness of interventions quickly dissipates with each hour delay in implementation. Our paper provides the first full-scale estimation of belief in and potential remedies for online misinformation at the scale of social media platforms.
